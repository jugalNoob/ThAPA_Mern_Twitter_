://\\JWT 

JSON Web Token is an open standard for securely transferring data within parties
 using a JSON object. JWT is used for stateless authentication mechanisms for
  users and providers, this means maintaining session is on the client-side instead 
  of storing sessions on the server. Here, we will implement the JWT authentication 
  system in NodeJs.


://\\cookiParser
//cookie-parser is a middleware which parses cookies attached to the client request 
object. To use it, we will require it in our index. js file; this can be used the same 
way as we use other middleware.


://\\ cors

::CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing . It allows us to relax 
the security applied to an API. This is done by bypassing the Access-Control-Allow-Origin
 headers, which specify which origins can access the API


 ://\\ENV
const port=process.env.PORT // this is means host another secure folder

://\\app.use(express.json())

:create json form data
